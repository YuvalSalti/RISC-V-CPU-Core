# RISC-V CPU Core Project

In here you will find all the information needed for creating a RISC-V CPU core.  
You can find the .tlv file and the final diagram of the RISC-V core in the reposetory.  
The project was coded on the [MakerChip IDE by by Redwood EDA, LLC](https://www.makerchip.com)

## What I learned
As part of course: [LinuxFoundationX: Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://www.edx.org/learn/design/the-linux-foundation-building-a-risc-v-cpu-core?index=product&queryId=3bb6d06bc63ec3feadaba0c9b3e1fe3d&position=1&correlationId=8718e6dc-c2fc-477f-babd-8de18aefee40), I had to implement a RISC-V CPU core using TL-Verilog.  
As the course progressed I learned about the the RV32I and the different parts of the RISC-V core.  
In the end  I earned a [edX Verified Certificate for Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/ad8311aeeadc438b9bdb23eab312ad3e)
